1. Added running and running speed for controlled entity
2. Added in control method for controller.  can now pass in a renderable object to be controlled by controller.
   	Commands not pertaining to entity should be wrapped in a conditional to see if controllee is null to refrain 
   	from null pointer exception, this should allow us to to have all the standard commands (escape bringing up menu, etc)
   	usable throughout the game without having to bog down the controller with a million conditionals
3. ADDED A FUCKING CHANGELOG :P
